  for those stores manually.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Install into the apps/community directory. The file structure of this plug-in should
  match where everything needs to go, so simply do a copy/paste.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>To start the setup, you will need to log in to the admin section of Magento.</p>

<p>
  <i>System > Configuration > IOSTUDIO > SyncContent Options</i>
</p>

<p><b>URL</b>: This is the URL where your site is when syncing the database. This is used so Magento doesn't do anything crazy.</p>

<p><b>Host</b>: This is the IP address or domain name for that server.</p>

<p><b>Username</b>: This is the username for that server.</p>

<p><b>Port</b>: This is used to configure the port in case you have SSH enabled on a nonstandard port.</p>

<p><b>Directory</b>: This is the path to where the store is installed on that server.</p>

<p><b>Rsync Options</b>: This is an advanced setting and is used whenever you are syncing
  content to or syncing content from that server.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>To use the scripts, you must be on the command line.</p>

<h3>shell/iostudio_synccontent.php</h3>

<p>Allows you to sync files and folders from one server to another</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>You are on your dev machine and you want to pull down files and folders from the
  production server. The command you would use is:</p>

<p>
  <i>php shell/iostudio_synccontent.php --sync-from production</i>
</p>


<p>The same command would be used if you are logged into the staging or test servers.
  In a nut shell, you are pulling down files and folders from production to the
  machine you are currently on.</p>

<h3>shell/iostudio_syncdatabase.php</h3>

<p>Allows you to sync the database from one server to another.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>You are on you development machine and you want to pull down the database from
  the production server. You would use this command:</p>

<p>
  <i>php shell/iostudio_syncdatabase.php --sync-from production</i>
</p>


<p>This command will make a backup of your database before it syncs the production
  database to your machine.</p>
